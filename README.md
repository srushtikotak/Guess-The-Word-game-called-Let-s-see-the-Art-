# Guess-The-Word-game-called-Let-s-see-the-Art-
Game similar to Hangman.

The program will show the player a word, but each character of the word is shown as "_". 
The player has to guess one character at a time. If the player guesses a correct character of the word, all characters will be displayed. 
Every time the player guesses wrong, more of a piece of ’character art’ will be chosen and shown. The game is over after 9 guesses.
